# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security issue, please do not open a public issue with sensitive details.
Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories (preferred) or contact the repository owner via LinkedIn message.

## Scope
This repository is a reference baseline for integrity data handling. It includes examples and sample data only.

## Guidance
- Do not upload client data, drawings, or confidential inspection records.
- Treat integrity datasets as decision-critical and protect lineage, access, and change history.
- Prefer deterministic transformations and explicit validation reports.
